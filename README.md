## About the Game

This game is a fun side project of building a game for web. It was created using a standard Vite React project.

It uses the following:

- [React](https://react.dev) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Konva](https://konvajs.org) for React and HTML5 Canvas components
- [XState](https://xstate.js.org) and [Stately.ai](https://stately.ai) for state machines
- [Howler](https://howlerjs.com) for sounds

The game also includes a genetic algorithm to evolve the characteristics of the hens who drop eggs.

This project was a demo for a talk, "Evolving Game Development with Genetic Algorithms" that was delivered at
