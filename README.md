## About the Game

This game is a fun side project of building a game for web. It was created using a standard Vite React project.

### Background

This project was a demo for a talk, "Evolving Game Development with Genetic Algorithms" that was delivered at

- [What The Stack](https://wts.sh) - Skopje, North Macedonia, September 14, 2024
- [React Alicante](https://reactalicante.es) - Alicante, Spain, September 21, 2024

### Technologies

The following is a list of the primary technologies and libraries being used used:

- [React](https://react.dev) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Konva](https://konvajs.org) for React and HTML5 Canvas components
- [XState](https://xstate.js.org) and [Stately.ai](https://stately.ai) for state machines
- [Howler](https://howlerjs.com) for sounds

### Genetic Algorithm

The game also includes a genetic algorithm to evolve the characteristics of the hens who drop eggs. The population is made up of the individual hens, each referred to as a "Hendividual". Their DNA is made up of characteristics related to their movement and egg laying capabilities.

### Dev Panel

There is a developer panel whose visibility can be toggled on/off in order to track the statistics related to the genetic algorithm.

Type `cmd-d` on the keyboard to toggle the visibility of the Dev Panel.

## Game Development

THIS GAME IS STILL IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

See the [Issues](https://github.com/kevinmaes/eggdrop/issues) for a list of possible upcoming features, fixes, and enhancements

Some notable omissions during development

- No instructions screen
- No end to the game
- The genetic algorithm is still being worked on

More coming soon...
