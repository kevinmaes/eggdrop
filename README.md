## üìñ About the Game

Egg Drop is a fun web-based game where you control Chef Rafi who tries to catch eggs dropped by hens to make his egg drop soup. It was inspired by the old [Atari 2600 game, Kaboom](https://www.atarimania.com/pgesoft.awp?soft=7179). Additionally, this version of game features a genetic algorithm that evolves the characteristics of the hens over time, making each playthrough unique and progressively challenging.

## üé≠ End-to-End Testing with Playwright

The game uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for end-to-end testing. These tests verify the game's functionality by simulating real user interactions and checking the game state.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run regular tests in headless mode
yarn test:e2e

# Run automated tests
yarn test:automated

# Run all tests
yarn test:all

# Run tests with browser visible
yarn test:e2e:headed

# Run tests in debug mode
yarn test:e2e:debug
```

### Test Types

The tests are organized into two categories:

1. **Regular Tests** (`@regular` tag):

   - Basic game functionality
   - UI interactions
   - State transitions
   - Run on every PR and push

2. **Automated Tests** (`@automated` tag):
   - Complex gameplay scenarios
   - Bot-driven gameplay
   - Longer running tests (5-minute timeout)
   - Run manually via GitHub Actions

### Test Architecture

The tests leverage the game's state machines through a special test API that's enabled when running in test mode. This approach overcomes several challenges typically associated with testing Canvas-based games:

1. **Canvas Testing Challenges**: Traditional Canvas applications are notoriously difficult to test because:

   - Canvas elements don't have a DOM representation to query
   - Visual state is not directly accessible through standard DOM APIs
   - Game state is often scattered across multiple components and render cycles
   - Animation frames make it hard to assert on exact positions and states
   - **Fake DOM elements:** Some projects add hidden or offscreen DOM elements to mirror canvas state for testing. While this allows DOM-based assertions, it introduces extra maintenance, risks test drift from real rendering, and pollutes the codebase with test-only logic. Ultimately, it doesn't guarantee the canvas output matches the tested state.

   While these traditional approaches are valid, they have significant drawbacks:

   - Visual testing is brittle and breaks with any UI change
   - Screenshot comparisons are slow and computationally expensive
   - Performance testing doesn't verify game logic
   - Visual tests can't easily verify internal state
   - Creating fake DOM elements adds overhead and extra code througout the application

   For more on these challenges, see:

   - [MDN Web Docs: Testing Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Optimizing_canvas#testing_performance) - Focuses on performance testing and optimization
   - [Playwright's Canvas Testing Guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#screenshot-comparisons) - Covers visual testing approaches

2. **State Machine Solution**: By using XState state machines, we can:

   - Access game state directly through the state machine's context
   - Query exact positions and velocities of game elements
   - Monitor state transitions and side effects
   - Make assertions about game state without relying on visual inspection

   This approach to testing Eggdrop is preferable because:

   - Tests are deterministic and reliable
   - Execution is faster than visual testing
   - Tests only break when game logic changes, not UI
   - We can test internal state that isn't visible
   - Complex game scenarios are easier to verify

3. **Test API**: When the game runs with `?testMode=true`, it exposes a `window.__TEST_API__` object that provides access to:

   - State machine actor references (app, chef, gameLevel)
   - Convenience getters for game state (score, chef position, etc.)
   - Direct event sending to state machines

4. **State Machine Integration**: Tests can:

   - Query the current state of any machine using `getSnapshot()`
   - Send events to machines using `send()`
   - Monitor state transitions and side effects
   - Assert on exact positions, velocities, and game state

5. **Game Automation**: Tests can simulate:
   - Keyboard input for chef movement
   - Game state transitions (start, pause, game over)
   - Score tracking and game progression
   - Complex game scenarios using the chefBot machine
   - Automated egg catching and scoring

This architecture makes it possible to write reliable, deterministic tests for a Canvas-based game, something that would be much more challenging with traditional testing approaches. For more on state machine testing, see:

### Viewing Test Results

#### Local Results

After running tests, you can view the HTML report:

```bash
# Open the last test report
yarn test:e2e:report
```

#### GitHub Actions Results

When tests run in GitHub Actions:

1. Navigate to the Actions tab in your PR
2. Click on the workflow run
3. Scroll to the "Artifacts" section
4. Download and open either:
   - `playwright-report` for regular tests
   - `playwright-automated-report` for automated tests

The reports include:

- Test execution videos
- Screenshots at each step
- Detailed error messages and stack traces
- Test duration and performance metrics

## üß™ CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration. The CI workflow:

1. Runs on all Pull Requests to the `main` branch
2. Verifies code quality with TypeScript and ESLint checks
3. Ensures all tests pass before merging
4. Confirms the build process works correctly

You can run these checks locally before pushing with:

```bash
yarn ci
```

## üß¨ Genetic Algorithm

The game features a genetic algorithm that evolves the characteristics of the hens who drop eggs. Each hen (referred to as a "Hendividual") has DNA composed of traits related to:

- Movement patterns and speed
- Egg-laying frequency and timing
- Other behavioral characteristics

As the game progresses, hens evolve based on their performance, creating a dynamic and increasingly challenging gameplay experience.

## üîß Developer Tools

### Dev Panel

The game includes a developer panel to track statistics related to the genetic algorithm:

- Press `cmd-d` (Mac) or `ctrl-d` (Windows/Linux) to toggle the Dev Panel visibility
- Monitor hen population statistics and evolution metrics
- Track game performance and state
