Add Storybuk demo studio for composable actor showcases

Introduces a comprehensive demo studio (Storybuk) that showcases individual actor state machines and their compositions. This zero-bloat platform enables developers to view, test, and understand actor behaviors in isolation and in combination.

Key features:

- Interactive story navigation with sprite icons and visual indicators
- Dual-mode demos showing both headless state machines and visual presentations
- Stately Inspector integration for real-time state machine visualization
- Individual actor stories (Chef, Hen, Egg, Chick) demonstrating core behaviors
- Multi-actor compositions showing synchronized interactions
- Presentation layouts optimized for demos (1920x1080)
- Play/pause/reset controls with synchronized playback
- Theme toggle support for different viewing preferences

Technical improvements:

- Refactored position calculations to match game pattern
- Enhanced sprite animations with improved timing and synchronization
- Centralized story configuration system
- Shared inspector utilities for state machine debugging
- TypeScript strict mode compliance across all stories
